    "In this assignment, you will use the Chat completion API to help users find restaurants by answering queries that express constraints on location, cuisine or food type, and amosphere. The assignment is designed as a sequence of steps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess restaurant and customer review data that is stored in JSON files.\n",
    "2. Use the chat completion API (ccAPI) to process the user query and extract intended location and cuisine.\n",
    "3. Find the restaurant(s) that satisfy the location and cuisine constraints.\n",
    "    - Use ccAPI to determine if a restaurant data indicates they offer the required cuisine.    \n",
    "    - Use ccAPI to also provide explanations for its response above.\n",
    "4. If more than one restaurant found, output the one that has the highest star rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, graduate students will also use the ccAPI and customer reviews as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If more than one restaurant found, give preference to the ones that have a fun ambiance or atmosphere.\n",
    "    - If multiple restaurants have a fun ambiance, output the one with the highest star rating.\n",
    "    - If no restaurant has a fun ambience, output the one with the highest star rating.\n",
    "2. Manually label the reviews with a binary \"fun ambience\" *label* and use this to compute the accuracy of ccAPI on the same labeling task."

      "Review: Typical pub food that isn't anything to drool over. The nightlife here is what probably keeps this place alive. Being near Ursinus College, the weekends attract a large college crowd with a fun environment. They have a fun outside \"beachy\" area with lights and games and you can sit at a table and eat out there too. It's always packed though. The only downside is you're staring at a parking lot while you're out there and a shopping center, but hey, that's what you're going to get for Collegeville. The staff is always friendly and they have a decent drink selection. If you want to come without the crowds, come during the day. It's fairly empty (or at least not packed). It is no fine dining, but the food isn't bad. The rib sandwich is pretty good which I'd recommend, although there were a lot of fatty areas- but some people may like this! I also had a BLT that was pretty good that comes with plain chips. Prices are just average. Not sure if I'll continue to come here for food, but I'd definitely come back for a happy hour.\n",
