    "text": "I usually don't like to visit new restaurants RIGHT when they open. I think they need some time to figure things out and get their servers trained to provide good service. However, we visited Livery immediately upon opening, since we love CRG restaurants, and it did NOT disappoint. We tried starters, entrees, desserts and drinks and all were excellent. The food had incredible flavors. The drinks were very well crafted (although the bartenders have been pretty slow each time we've visited) using 4+ ingredients. I can't say enough good things about the food! The space is beautiful. I love he original brick mixed with lots of modern touches. It doesn't look like any other CRG restaurant. It has upbeat, load music that lends to a fun bar atmosphere. With small plates moderately priced you can spend as little or as much as your budget allows. If you haven't checked it out yet it's definitely worth your time!",

    "text": "Saw them cooking tacos on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant , so that got our interest . We were urged to try them by a few employees standing outside . They were really friendly , but we wanted to sit down , so we went in . Everybody working there had some freaky makeup on for Halloween . Even the strolling musicians . Our waiter was top notch , had a great personality . I ordered the spicy mango chicken wings that were huge and tasty . My friend had the $11 taco plate . Which consisted of 2 of the street tacos sold out front , plus beans and rice . The tacos were al pastor or pork tacos , which he said were delicious , but not abnormally large or small . Just 2 regular corn tortilla tacos . Could have been bigger for $11 . The rice and beans were decent . Again not a huge portion . But decent enough . The musicians were doing Spanish versions of American songs . And the atmosphere was super fun and the employees were friendly and truly seemed like they wanted to be there . Will definitely be back . The 2 tacos had to be the same kind and there was an upheaved for certain tacos , which weren't mentioned on the menu , but our waiter did tell us . Even qdoba will give you different tacos . For the employees and the taste , we will be back . For the value and the stupid 1 type of taco rule , they get a 1 star deduct . Way more inventive menu than most Mexican restaurants in the area . I eat out , pretty much everyday of my life , and this one will be in my rotation when I'm in edwardsville .",

    "text": "Typical pub food that isn't anything to drool over. The nightlife here is what probably keeps this place alive. Being near Ursinus College, the weekends attract a large college crowd with a fun environment. They have a fun outside \"beachy\" area with lights and games and you can sit at a table and eat out there too. It's always packed though. The only downside is you're staring at a parking lot while you're out there and a shopping center, but hey, that's what you're going to get for Collegeville. The staff is always friendly and they have a decent drink selection. If you want to come without the crowds, come during the day. It's fairly empty (or at least not packed). It is no fine dining, but the food isn't bad. The rib sandwich is pretty good which I'd recommend, although there were a lot of fatty areas- but some people may like this! I also had a BLT that was pretty good that comes with plain chips. Prices are just average. Not sure if I'll continue to come here for food, but I'd definitely come back for a happy hour.",

    "text": "Well done Saint Louis. I didn't dream of having a Boiling Crab-esque restaurant out here, but here I am. Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The \"whole shabang\" (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.\n\nI think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!\n\nMy advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.\n\nOverall, well done and I'll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends.",

The ambiance was nice despite that someone had to bring their yowling babe (and at 9 PM!) The waiter was nice and sat us away from the squalling babe.  We ate Degustation, which is reasonable compared to many Prix Fix restaurants.  \n\nI ate there with a friend who is a chef. The melon, cucumber and mint soup was a little bitter.  The corn soup was just right.  The pate was curiously bland, needing something.  The Salmon Tartare was good.  The Divers Scallops had a curious bitter under taste.  my friend believes that they were not fresh but had some preservative.  The steak frites was fine, a little bland.  The cheese plate was delicious and the desert was very good.  \n\nOverall, the food was nothing to write home about.  The staff was friendly and polite.  The table of young ladies were a bit much with their cackling.  And is it too much to ask you keep your infants home with a sitter?",

    "text": "After hearing a lot about this place and driving by it constantly, I finally decided to make a trip with my fiance. Upon entering it has a nice, casual, amusing look. There are many humorous signs on the walls and it is very clean.\n\nWait staff is very welcoming and kind. It didn't take too long to get our drinks ordered and they gave us plenty of time to look over the surprisingly large menu. Most items are fairly well priced but some of the BBQ combos can be a little on the high side at $17.99.\n\nWith that said, I ordered the Hogwild Combo and my fiance ordered the BBQ Rib plate. Portions are generous and well plated. The pulled pork was absolutely amazing, while the chicken was extremely dry and needed a sip of your drink just to be able to swallow it. This happens with BBQ sometimes, and will not deter me from ordering the chicken again. The ribs were also quite good. Mine were not dry at all and came off the bone marvelously, no tug at all. My fiance's ribs were good as well, but the end of her slab was very thin, thus resulting in a few much drier ribs (the part of the ribs that were center cut were quite good).\n\nOverall the food had excellent flavor and was not overly smoked. The corn on the cob was fantastic, as was the thick, Texas Toast style Garlic bread served with the meal. The fries are seasoned just enough and went extremely well with their ranch.\n\nOverall this was a fantastic meal. I would have liked if the combo plates were slightly less, but it will not stop me from going back and getting the same thing again. Next time I will try the brisket, as they were out of it tonight.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes BBQ, and fitting for the entire family!\n\nAlso, I provided pictures of every page on the menu. I hope they help!",

On my first visit, I started with sweet potato fries and a groothie smoothie. Both were winners in my book.\n\nBut, next week came the challenge - Pleasing my meat and potatoes husband. On the cashier's recommendation we went with the Crispy Ranch and Buffalo 'bella, along with fries and green lemonade. Everything was good, but left us feeling greasy. The sauces were impressively creamy and the fake meat spot-on. But was it better than a burger? Probably not. Was it healthier? Debatable. \n\nNext time, I will try something not fried. And there certainly will be a next time, because I need to try the delicious looking banana whip. And because, even if you leave greasy, you feel a bit better about yourself.",

    "text": "A gem of a restaurant tucked away in a small strip plaza that is much larger than it first looks. Our server John was very attentive & friendly. He had a great number of regular patrons that he greeted & already knew their drinks of choice.  They all seemed so happy to see John. I was amazed how many regulars were there. Do make a reservation since every table was occupied plus a few couples waited at the bar. \n\nThe food was tasty & visually a delight.  My pork tenderloin was excellent.  Only reason why no 5 star was the bread pudding. I overheard a woman tell her server that the bread pudding was too doughy. I second the motion. It was doughy & very dense. It needed a few raisins to break up the dense texture. \n\nEveryone around us was ordering the chicken Marsala so that will be my next visit meal. Happy hour on Saturday was 4-7",

    "text": "This resturant is beautiful and the food is amazing! The house bread is so yummy, as well as the house sangria. The atmosphere is very swanky with well dressed good looking people at every table. My only complaint  is that we sat for 15- 20 mins without a wine list, menu, and water when we were seated.  For the price, I expect better service. I will try it again.",

    "text": "Really great foodie dive. The Abyssinia special is your best bet. It is essentially a sampler platter with plenty for 2. We still filled a to go box. Add on 2 spiced teas and your whole bill with tip is only $20. They have all your favorite Ethiopian homestyle dishes served ip with fresh injera.",
