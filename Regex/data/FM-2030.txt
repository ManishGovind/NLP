Esfandiary''' ({{lang-fa|فریدون اسفندیاری}}); October 15, 1930 – July 8, 2000) was a Belgian-born [[Iranian-American]] author, teacher, [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher, [[futurist]], consultant and athlete.<ref name="nytimes obituary">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/11/us/futurist-known-as-fm-2030-is-dead-at-69.html |title=Futurist Known as FM-2030 Is Dead at 69 |access-date=2009-08-25 |last= Martin|first= Douglas|date=July 11, 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
The son of an [[Foreign relations of Iran|Iranian diplomat]], he travelled widely as a child, having lived in 17 countries by age 11; then, as a young man, he [[Iran at the 1948 Summer Olympics#Basketball|represented Iran]] as a basketball player at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]] in London.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/11/us/futurist-known-as-fm-2030-is-dead-at-69.html |title=Futurist Known as FM-2030 Is Dead at 69 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 11, 2000 |access-date=October 8, 2015}}</ref> He then started his college education at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but later transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he graduated in 1952.<ref name="NYPL Biography">{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/4846}}</ref> Afterwards, he served on the [[UNSCOP|United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine]] from 1952 to 1954.<ref name=nypl>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/fm2030.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326114647/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/fm2030.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-26|title=F.

==Name change==
In the mid-1970s F.M. Esfandiary legally<ref name="nyt" /> changed his name to FM-2030 for two main reasons. Firstly, to reflect the hope and belief that he would live to celebrate his 100th birthday in 2030; secondly, and more importantly, to break free of the widespread practice of [[naming conventions]] that he saw as rooted in a [[collectivist]] mentality, and existing only as a relic of humankind's tribalistic past. He viewed traditional names as almost always stamping a label of [[collective identity]] – varying from [[gender]] to nationality – on the individual, thereby existing as prima facie elements of thought processes in the human cultural fabric, that tended to degenerate into stereotyping, factionalism, and discrimination. In his own words, "Conventional names define a person's past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [...] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time. In 2030 we will be [[ageless]] and everyone will have an excellent chance to live forever. 2030 is a dream and a goal."<ref name=npr>{{cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1076532 |title=Fm-2030 |publisher=NPR |date=2000-07-11 |access-date=2011-03-12}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He was a lifelong vegetarian and said he would not eat anything that had a mother.<ref name="cryonics 2000">{{cite news|url=http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics2000-4.pdf |title=A Tribute to FM-2030 |access-date=2009-08-25 |last= Chamberlain|first= Fred|date=Winter 2000 |publisher=Alcor Life Extension Foundation }}</ref> FM-2030 once said, "I am a 21st century person who was accidentally launched in the 20th.

FM-2030 was, in his own words, a follower of "upwing" politics, in which he meant that he endorsed universal progress.<ref>[https://aeon.co/essays/left-and-right-are-over-the-future-is-up-and-down Ninety-degree revolution: Right and Left are fading away.

==Death==
On July 8, 2000, FM-2030 died from [[pancreatic cancer]] and was placed in [[cryonic suspension]] at the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona, where his body remains today. He did not yet have remote standby arrangements, so no Alcor team member was present at his death, but FM-2030 was the first person to be [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrified]], rather than simply frozen as previous [[cryonics]] patients had been.<ref name="cryonics 2000"/> FM-2030 was survived by four sisters and one brother.<ref name="nyt" />
