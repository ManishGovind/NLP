'''The University of North Carolina at Charlotte''' ('''UNC Charlotte''', '''UNCC''', or simply '''Charlotte'''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.charlottefive.com/stop-mangling-unc-charlottes-name/|title=Stop mangling UNC Charlotte’s name|date=2018-11-15|work=The Charlotte Five|access-date= January 3, 2019|language=en}}</ref>) is a [[public education|public]] [[research university]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. UNC Charlotte offers 23 doctoral, 64 master's, and 140 bachelor's degree programs through nine colleges: the College of Arts + Architecture, the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, the Belk College of Business, the College of Computing and Informatics, the Cato College of Education, the William States Lee College of Engineering, the College of Health and Human Services, the Honors College, and the University College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.uncc.edu/academics|title=Academics|date=July 9, 2014|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

UNC Charlotte is the largest institution of higher education in the Charlotte region. The university has experienced rapid enrollment growth of 33% over the past 10 years, making it the fastest-growing institution in the UNC System and contributing to more than 50% of the system's growth since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ninertimes.com/2017/06/how-the-n-c-budget-could-impact-unc-charlotte/|title=How the N.C. budget could impact UNC Charlotte|date=June 27, 2017|website=ninertimes.com}}</ref> It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".<ref name=carnegie>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=199139 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |access-date=13 September 2020}}</ref> In 2020, it surpassed the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] to become the second-largest school in the UNC system by student enrollment.

It has three campuses: Charlotte Research Institute Campus, Center City Campus, and the main campus, located in [[University City, North Carolina|University City]]. The main campus sits on 1,000 wooded acres with approximately 85 buildings about {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Uptown Charlotte.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://admissions.uncc.edu/about|title=About UNC Charlotte|date=July 9, 2014|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

The city of Charlotte had sought a public university since 1871 but was never able to sustain one. For years, the nearest state-supported university was {{convert|90|mi|km}} away. The city submitted a bid in the late 1880s for what would become [[North Carolina State University]], but lost to the city of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] after a local farmer offered to donate land for the campus.<ref name="Sanford, Ken 1996, p. 5">Sanford, Ken. "Charlotte and UNC Charlotte: Growing Up Together". UNC Charlotte Press, 1996, p. 5.</ref> In 1946, the city sought a state-run medical school; instead, the state expanded the [[University of North Carolina School of Medicine|existing two-year school]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]].<ref name="Sanford, Ken 1996, p. 5"/>

On September 23, 1946, the State of [[North Carolina]] opened the '''Charlotte Center of the University of North Carolina''' with an enrollment of 278 students.<ref>Sanford, Ken. "Charlotte and UNC Charlotte: Growing Up Together". UNC Charlotte Press, 1996, p. 9.</ref> It was founded to serve the educational needs of returning World War II veterans. Like many of the United States' "[[post–World War II baby boom|post–World War II]]" universities, it owes its inception to the [[G.I. Bill]] and its effects on [[public education]]. In 1949, when the state began closing the centers, the Charlotte Center was taken over by the city school district and became '''Charlotte College''', a two-year [[junior college]]. It was first funded by student tuition payments, then by local property taxes. Classes were held at Central High School near uptown Charlotte, but by 1957, enrollment increased to 492, and the school's leaders began searching for a permanent site for the campus. They decided on a 250-acre (1&nbsp;km²) tract of land northeast of the city near the [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus County]] border.<ref>Sanford, Ken. "Charlotte and UNC Charlotte: Growing Up Together". UNC Charlotte Press, 1996, pp. 44–46.</ref> The college became state-supported in 1958 upon joining the newly formed [[North Carolina Community College System]] and moved to its current location in 1961.

In 1963, Charlotte College became a four-year college. On July 1, 1965, it merged with the Consolidated University of North Carolina (since 1972 called the [[University of North Carolina]]) under its current name. In 1969, the university began offering programs leading to master's degrees. In 1992, it was authorized to offer programs leading to doctoral degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicrelations.uncc.edu/default.asp?id=26|title=UNC Charlotte :: Public Relations :: University History|access-date=May 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025003239/http://www.publicrelations.uncc.edu/default.asp?id=26|archive-date=October 25, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Bonnie Ethel Cone, founder====
{{main|Bonnie Ethel Cone}}
[[File:Conegrave.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Bonnie Cone's final resting place on the campus of UNC Charlotte, with Cato Hall and Fretwell Hall in the background. Also thought to be the meeting place of Diu Memoriae Consilium.]]
[[Bonnie Ethel Cone]] (1907–2003), or Miss Bonnie as she was known to students, was chosen to as director of the Charlotte Center in 1946. From 1949 to 1965, she served as president of Charlotte College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uncc.edu/manuscript/ms0112|title=UNC Charlotte Finding Aids - Search - Text: ms0112|website=library.uncc.edu|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> When Charlotte College joined the UNC system in 1965, Cone served as acting chancellor until 1966.

====Chancellors====
[[Dean W. Colvard]] (1913–2007) was appointed the first chancellor of the young university in 1966. A North Carolina native, Colvard had served as president of [[Mississippi State University]] (MSU). At MSU he was the first president to defy university policy of not playing against integrated teams when he ordered the men's basketball team to play [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1963. At UNC Charlotte, Colvard took on the challenge of converting the school from a small college to a four-year member of the UNC system. Indeed, he had been chosen specifically because UNC system officials believed the newly-minted UNC Charlotte needed a leader with experience running a four-year university. Colvard oversaw accreditation of the university, development of University Research Park (now one of the top five largest research parks in the country), constructed the first residence halls, created the first graduate programs, and grew the enrollment from about 1,700 to just over 8,000 students. He retired as chancellor in 1978, served as Chancellor [[Emeritus]] until his death. Colvard also received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. The Colvard building, completed on the main campus in 1979, is named in his honor and houses the Department of Psychology.

[[E.K. Fretwell]] (1923–2012), the second chancellor of the university, was named in 1979. He came to the university from Buffalo State College where he was president. Under Fretwell, campus enrollment surged from 8,000 students to over 12,000. He oversaw the creation of the Graduate School, created more graduate degrees, integrated the library's card catalog into the Internet in 1983, created the groundwork for a major business incubator, helped to develop the university's surrounding neighborhood, and increased academic grants to over $6.1&nbsp;million. Fretwell retired as chancellor in 1989. He served as interim president of the [[University of Massachusetts]] system from 1991–1992, and in 1998, he served as the interim president of the [[University of North Florida]]. In 1996 UNC Charlotte opened the Fretwell building, dedicated in honor of him and his wife Dorrie. The building headquarters the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences.

[[James H Woodward|James H. Woodward]] succeeded Fretwell in 1989. Woodward came to UNC Charlotte from the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] where he served as dean of engineering and senior vice president of academic affairs. Under Woodward, enrollment grew to over 19,000 students. Like his predecessors, he continued the growth of the Graduate School and added new doctoral programs. He oversaw the largest fundraising campaign in the school's history and its largest building boom; in the summer of 2005, no less than six buildings were actively under construction on the main campus. He also oversaw the creation of the CRI Campus. Woodward announced his retirement in 2004 and left the office of chancellor on June 30, 2005. Woodward Hall, which houses the College of Computing & Informatics, was dedicated in his honor on November 16, 2005. He is currently Chancellor Emeritus and teaches in the university's William States Lee College of Engineering.

Philip L. Dubois is the fifth leader and fourth chancellor of the university. Dr. Dubois assumed his duties as chancellor on July 15, 2005. He returned to Charlotte after serving as the president of the [[University of Wyoming]] from 1997 through 2005. Previously, he was the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science (now the Department of Political Science and Public Administration) at UNC Charlotte from 1991 until 1997. Dubois, along with his wife and children, is the first chancellor to occupy the Chancellor's Residence (known as the Bissell House) on the UNC Charlotte campus that was completed in the winter of 2005. He is expected to oversee the process of the university becoming the fourth research-extensive university in the state.

==Campuses==

===Main Campus – University City===
The university operates several campuses in Charlotte. The Main Campus is situated on just under 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of rolling land between [[U.S. Route 29]] and [[North Carolina Highway 49|N.C. Highway 49]], about 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) from Uptown Charlotte in the [[University City, North Carolina|University City]] neighborhood. The campus is self-contained, meaning that no major roads run through the campus. The campus boasts several [[Reservoir|man-made lakes]], and is heavily wooded. Near the center of campus are two gardens that attract over 300,000 visitors a year. The architecture of the original central campus, particularly the oldest buildings, are precast concrete and utilitarian-looking because they were built with limited state funds in the 1960s and 1970s. Starting in 2014, these buildings are being renovated to today's standards. Under the campus' third chancellor, James Woodward, the campus underwent major changes which continue today. The newest buildings, funded from state bonds, are being constructed in brick with neoclassical architecture. Concrete and asphalt sidewalks have largely been replaced by brick. The campus' road system is being upgraded to include landscaped medians and more trees.<ref name="cri.uncc.edu">{{cite web|url=http://cri.uncc.edu/about-cri|title=About CRI - Charlotte Research Institute - UNC Charlotte|website=cri.uncc.edu|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

===Charlotte Research Institute Campus===
The [[Charlotte Research Institute]] was created in 2000. It sits on a 100-acre (0.4&nbsp;km²) campus, attached to the main UNCC campus, on a tract of land originally named the Millennial Campus. The research-oriented CRI Campus focuses on precision metrology and intelligent manufacturing, optoelectronics and optical communication, and software and information technology. This campus brings together faculty, students, and outside researchers to work together.

The CRI Campus also houses the new, on-campus football stadium, with 15,300 initial seats that can be expanded to more than 40,000.<ref name="cri.uncc.edu"/>

===Center City Campus===
